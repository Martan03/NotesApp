This is my first app in .NET MAUI.

For the beginning I tried something easy and that was notes app.

First page shows all your notes. I added two notes and it looks like this:

When you want to add a note, you have to click the plus button in the top right corner. That new page will open up. There you will be able to type the note you want to save.

When you want to open already existing note, you can simply click on note card. It'll open same page as when adding note. You can edit note or just read it. Also, you can remove the note by clicking the bin button in the top right corner.

Good to mention:
Notes are being saved automatically

(it's really that simple app (: )
